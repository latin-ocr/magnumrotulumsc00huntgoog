The accompra in the Exchequer are made up to m opinion:
the twenty-niuth day of September in each year. ‘naal'
My position is, that these are the accompts of the
year ending in 1130, September ΞΘ. This day falling
within the thirty-first year of the reign of Henry
the First. the roll would according to the usual
praefice be called the roll of that year, although the
affairs treated of in it would occur for the most part
in the thirtieth year of that King’s reign, his reign
commencing on or about the fisth day of August.

That these accompts do not belong to au earlier omna-ur
period may be inserted with the highest confidente 'ffiwfflm'
from the frequent occurrence of the Bishop of Win-

difficulty in this case arises from the circumstance,
that in no instance does the name of the Bishop ap-

Giffard, or Henry of Blois, who is the Bishop im
tended. But while the probability is greatly in favour
of Henry, who was the King’s nephew, the sou of
his sister Adela, this is rendered certain, by what is
found in the accompts of the Sherifl· of Devonshire,

the Bishop had the Abbey.'' The Bishop of Win-

chester had been mentioued just before. Now,

Henry of Blois, the Abbot of Glastonhury, was not

appointed to the Bishopriek of Winchester before

October, 1129 ; and his consecration took place on

the seventeenth day of November following?

A limitation in the other direction may be guthered nemin: mm
