which the most remarkable is that which is to be
found nt pase) of the present volume, where we bave
Brienfius filius Comitis rendering acoompt of the
Auxilium Burgi of Warengeford, which he does in
the following terma:
xv. li. de veteri auxilio burgi tercii anni:
xv. li. de auxilio burgi preteriti anni:
xv. li. de novo auxilio burgi.
There is another in nearly the same terma at p.77.

thusz—We bave here the accompt of the present
year, of the last past, and the one immediately
preceding, which is called the third year of some
King's reign t hence the accompts are of the Fisth
year of some reign; and since the persons named in
them ase all people who flourisbed in the former half
of the twelsth century, and as the fisth of Henry
the Erat is tuo early aud the fisth of Heniy the
Second too late, we must come to the conclusion that
this in the roll of the ffisth year of King Stephen.
No doubt the inference was good were but the
premises sound. But the tercii anni in the above
quotation does not necessarily require to be taken in
the sense of the Third year of any King's reign:
but, according to the usage in these accompts, may
as well be the Third year, reckoning backward, from
the year in which the accompts were taken. This
in shown at large by Madox in his Letver tu Lord
Somers, by numerous citatiuns from the rolls of
Henry the Second and Richard. One instance will
be sufficient. In the roll of the Eleventh year of
King Henry 11„ in the accompt for Hampshise,
Hugo de Gundovill stands indebted
