PREFACE. vll

is so fas at var-lance with truth and probability that
it would scarcely deserve a serious refutation.

The proof that this is not the true date arises (1.) M&-
from the utter want of any correspondency with the
roll of the Second year of King Henry the Second,
while in two contiguous rolls of annual accornpts
there must needs be such correspondency, debts
from a former year being brought forward in the ac-
compm of that which succeeds: (2.) the list of
Sheriffs of the Counties in the First year of King
Heni-y the Second, in the Red Book ofthe Exchequer,
differs entirely from the Sheriffi aa they appear in
this record : (3.) many persons occur as then active
in the King’s service, or as possessing ecclesiastical
diguities, concerning whom there is the whole current
of history, shewing that they were dead long before
the accession of King Henry the Second. On the
whole, this date can he regarded in no other light
than as the hasty conclusion of some unknown per-
son, who finding a series of rolls commencing with
the Second year of the reign of one of our Kings,
and an unappropriated roll beside, concluded that
this must be the roll that was required to make the
series of that reign complete.

When the attention of the Antiquaries of England
began to be directed on this document as one of the
sources of historical knowledge, the error of the
office-date was soon discovered, and the roll itself
is now made to protest against it. On a slip of
parchment attached to the roll, and in a modern
hand⁷ the following refutation of the old opinion is
written, and at the same time a. proposal is made of
another year as that to which the record is to be end opinion:
referred z—The Fisth year of King Staephen. ⁵ ⁵¹‘9h'
