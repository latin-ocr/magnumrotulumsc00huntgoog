While there is mention of every Bishop who wan neronum-ae
living in 1180, and many of them are mentioned ἵξιὲἓῆιὲιὲη
many times, no Bishop of Carlisle occurs. Why?

The see was not founded till 1152.

Frequent allusion ir made oo the King's absence κίῃς-..υκαι-
in Nnrmandy. Henry went thither in the August ‘¹¹ NW⁶5⁴
