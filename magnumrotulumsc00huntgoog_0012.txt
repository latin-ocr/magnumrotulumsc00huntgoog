PREFACE.

Chartularies of the Religious Houses. A contem-
porary nationa] document relating to the transactione
of those reigns must, therefore, he regarded as pos-
sessing extraordinary value: and it has fortunately
happened that the same persons who have preserved
the series of Annual Accompm, have preserved also
another roll, containing the accompts of another year,
and that year preceding the year at which the
series commences, and separated from it by a long
interval.

This roll of Annual Accorupts, which is the most
antient Record of the Exchequer, it has been deter-
,mined to print as a separate work, before the early
rolls of the series itself: for though of precisely the
same nature with the rolls which form the series,
and having evidently once been a member of a
series, it is now an insulated document, having
none before it, nor any following and immediately
connected with it. It contains similar matter in a
similar arrangement: it was prepared with the same
official diligence and care: it has been preserved in
the same custody: and it has equa] authority, as
legal evidence, with any roll that is comprehended
within the series,

In surm, it consiste of sixteen smaller rolls, which
are stitched together at the head. Each of these
smaller rolls consists of two membranes, most of
which are written on both sides. These smaller rolls
are of unequal length, sorne more, some less, than four
feet. The width is about twelve inches. The chae
racter in which the record is written is tall and bold,
and scarcely ever even in its minima presenting
anything to perplex the transcriber. The second or
lower membrana of the fourth roll, which contained
portioris of the accompts for Hampshioe, has long
been separated from the other membrane, and lost.
