I add what is not observed hy Madox, that the
roll itself contains one decisive pruof that the mode
of reckouiug the years was not hythe number of the
years of the reign, but by reckoning the years hack-
ward from the then present year. It isin the curious
accompts of the city of Carlisle at p.141, where we
have persons rendering accompt of the Geldum
Animalium for five years, the years before the pre-
sent being thus described:-

preoeriti anni
tercii anni
quarti anni
quinti anui.

At the same time, though fully acquiescing in the
conclusion uf Madox and the soundness of the mode
of proof used by him, in justice to the older antiquary
it must be observed, that the principle on which he
understood that the Scribes proceedetl in denomi-
nat-ing the years for which accompts were rendered,
when the accompts extended backward into several
precedent years, was a principle soon asterwards
adopted by them. Of this the roll of the Third of
King John lately published from the Chauceuor's
Antigraph, affords the most palpable evidence: for
we find the Earl of Leicester there rendering accompt
of the firm of Belgi-ave fur five years, which years
are designated thus z—hoc anno—preterito anuo—
anno primo—anno decimo—anuo nono :⁹ the uume-
rals plainly indicating the years of the reign of John,
and of his predecessor, Richard.

That the Record cannot belong to the Fisth year
of King Stephen may be evinced by the following opinion
facts :--(1.) In the fifth of King Stepheu the country ’ψη
