mna- volume; but Alexander was not made Bishop of

'ffissffltd Linooln before the 25th year of that King's reign.

m The question was taken up fflrly in ffie lut
cennary by Madox, the author of the Hismry and
Antiquities ofthe Exchequer. He so far condemn-‘ln
tu the opinion which prevailed in his time, that lue
quotes the roll throughout that truly learned und
admirable work, as the roll of the nah of Stepben,
though he has annexed to that Hismry his Imm fio
Lord Somers, in which he shows that it cannot belong
ω that year, and that it is in fact a roll of the reign
of Henry the First. It is 3 proof of the candum·
and cantion of that distinguished anfiquaeuy, that be
bns allowed the question there to rest without attempt-
ing to fix any particular year of that reign ns that
in which these accompts were made up. The witer
of this Pref'ace may owe 311 apology to the public,
that he has ventui-ed to advauce a step further; and
it is due to himself to state, that astet such an ex-
ample of forbearance on the part of so distinguished
a man, it 1133 not been without some reluctance that
he has placed in the title page of this Volume a par-
ticular year as thet to which these accompts are to
be referred. However, the grounds of the opinion
will now be faithfully exhibited: and the Record
itself being printed and made public, is so open to
the view and study of 311 rnen, that no error on such
ι point as this ean romain long undetected. Resides
he 1133 the satisfaction of finding the conclusion to
which his own study of the Record has led him so
nearly coincident with that osso great 3 cn'tic in our
early histories as the present Keeper of the Records
at the Tower, who in 3 preface to 3 private publica-
tion of 3 Norman Pipe Roll, 1133 a passing notice of
the roll before us, in which he assigns it to the
twenty-ninth or thirtieth year of King Hem-y Ι.
