The wonder rather is, that so much should have Damnem-1

lust. For this is evidently a document saved from a ἓξὲξ ”“’”““

wreck, which were not this saved would be total,
of all the Grest Rolls of the Exchequer preceding
the reign of Henry II. Why its companions were
suffered to perish, or designedly destroyed, we nre
lest to conjecture, in the silence of history and the
absence of evidence. But that this was not always
an insulated and solitary document, that there were
in fact rolls extending through the whole reign of
Henry 1.. and probably back to the period when first
the Court of Exchequer was established, we have, in
addition to the probabilities in the case, the sufficient
evidence of Sweresord‚ the compiler of the Red
Book of the Exchequer, who, in a passage cited by
Madox, says, that he had himself inspected n few of
the Annual Rolls of that reign.

Of a record so antient and valuable as this much
use has been made by antiquarian, legal, and histo-
rical writers, under all the disadvaumges attending
the means of access. And among the peculiarities
of this interesting document, it occurs now to he
mentioned, that very discordant opinions have been
maintained respecting the year, and even the reign,
to which it belongs. Like most other early docu-
ments of the English monarchy, this roll was pre-
pared without any contemporary and authoritative
declaration of the time when the accompts which it
contains were rendered. It must not now go forth
without a brief review of these opinions, and a justi-
ficatiou of the date which in this publication is as-
signed to it, Important errors have grown out of
an erroneous opinion on this subject ; and it is mani-
fest that much of its usefulness must depend upon
