exhibitu a state of perfect internal peace. (2.)1n
the fisth os Stephen‚ the Earl of Gloucester, Brient

of money by the King's command. (8.) In the fifth

through which he passed in going and returning.

sixth year of King Stephen was actively engaged in
the behalf of Maud: iu the roll we find him paying
400 marks of silver that he might possess the office
of Dapifer Regis.-Numerous other inconsistencies
might be pointed out: but I shall content myself
