PREFACE-

doubt upon a subject which has long been cousi-
dered as very obscure and perplexed with many
difficulties.

That the question was not unworthy of the minute
investigation by which alone it is possible to arrive
at any satisfactory conclusion is evident from this ε
that if we go on to regard aud to quote the roll as
belonging to the Fifth year of King Stephem we
are placed in this dilemma, that we must abandou
the Chroniclers as unfaithful relaters of the events of
the early years of Stephen‚ or we must distrust oue
of the most famous of the records of the realm—
praeclarum et magnificum antiquitatis ιῐιοῐιιιιῃθτι-7
tum ³—for no ingenuity can recoucile the state of
affairs as they are described in the Chronicles, with
the state of affairs as exhibited inrthis roll ;—while
by having the date clearly ascertained by some one
or two decisivo coincidencies, we are prepared to
admit the rest, and to observe how the statements
of the Chronicles are borne out by the contemporary
document, and how the matter of the document itself
ruay be illus ated from the C hronicles. ⁷

Madox, with singular inconsistency in making out

ni* his Catalogue of the Barons of the Exchequer, has

 

placed six persons upon his list as iu that dignity in
the reign of stephen‚ on the sole authority of this roll.

*¹ Ἰ ²* But the book in which the effect of the wrong assigu-

ment of this record is more peculiarly felt is the
Baronage of Eugland. In the marg-in of that great
and invaluable work are sorty-six references to this
roll as the roll of the Fisth ofStephen, and in every
one of these instances there is some fact misplaced
by at least nine years, and great inconsisteucies in,
