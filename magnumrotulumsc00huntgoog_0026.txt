PREFACE.

Episcopi. Two years, and a small portion of the
time of Flembard, conducts us to the end of Sep-
tember, Aa). 1150.

In the accomprs of the Sheriff of Berksffire, pass-3,
we have the following notice of Vincentius the Abbot
of the Monastery of Abingdon z that he rendered
accompt of seventy marks of the pleae of Gefl'ery de

Clintou, and a. discharge of the seventy marks fol. ,

rendered accompt. It is, as if he stood charged,
and theu, on hearing of his death, the officers were
ordered to enter a discharge. Now the contem-

Abendonensis,· relates that Abbot Vincentius died
on the 4th of the kalends of April. A.D. 1130.

The case of the Bishop of Winchester rnny be
considered as having established a limitation in that

within which the enquiry into this question must be
conducted to years not earlier than 1129. Ι add
in further corroboration of this that there is mention
in the roll, os Hugh the Archbishop of Rouen, whose
consecrat-ion took place st the feast of the Exalta⁴
tion of the Holy Cruss, (September 14,) 1180, the
King of England being present.† The Annnls of
Wavetley speak of him as the Archbishop then
newly elected,1 and if we might be at liberty to
