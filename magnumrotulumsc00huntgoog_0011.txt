through the hands of the Sheriffs and other Minis-
ter-⁴3 in the different enunties, we obtain through
these accompts a view of no inconsiderable por-
tion of the royal expenditure in a long tract of
time, by which a clear and valuable light is
thrown on many subjects, and sometimes ou the
most imponant public transactione of the realm.
Madox, a man who was intimately acquainted with
the whole tseasure of the national records, speaks of
these rolls in his Letter to Lord Somers, as being—
Recorda, omnium quae in archivis Regis usquam
vidisse me memini, splendidissima; post Rotulum
Censualem quem Librum Domesday vocant3 quin ei
aequiparanda.--Iu forming, however, an opinion of
their value so exalted as this, he must be understood
to speak of the whole series; not of a single roll,
which may be coutemplated alone ; aud regard must
have been had to their character as legal evidence,
affecting many important rights and stanchises; to
the use which may be made of them in historical
investigations, and more particularly in such investi-
gations when they are directed to points of consti-
tutioual or legal histuzy5 to the bearing of the
information which they contain on the state of
society in Englaud, and its changes through suc-
cessive centuries; and finally to the remoteness of
the period at which the series commences.

But though the Secund year of King Henry the
Second is a time from which little that is docu-
mentary besides these accompts, has come down to
ue, yet the period before the reign of Henry IL,
when the sons and grandson of the Conqueror were
upon the throne, is still more destitute of docu-
mentary national evidence. What we know of the
men and transactions of those reigns is almost ex-
clusively derived from the Chroniclers, and from the
