PREFACE.

591,οω that the Knights of the Bishoprick of Ely
may keep ward in the Isle of Ely as is done at the
Cassse of Norwich. These entries plainly show that
Herveius was alive when these accompts were
rendered: yet the time of his death, according to
the Obituary of the Church of Ely and other autho-
rities, was the year 1181, ou the 30th day of August. ¹*
This is the time uf his death generally received. It
must however he added, that one Chronicler places
his death in 1183.

Agaiu, Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham,

n died ou the 5th of September 1128. The King did

not immediately appoiut a successum but held the
bishoprick in his own hands for nearly five years.
The care of the revenues he committed to John de
Amundevilla, and Geffery Escossand. The words
of the Confinuatnr of Simeon are express z—Eo
autem defuncto, committitur Episcopatus duobus
Batonibus, videlicet Johanni de Amundivilla, et
Gaufrido seniori Escollaud ad opus Regis censum
colligentibus. † The accompts of the Bishoprick of
Dur-ham in the roll are iu exact accordance with
this. We find Escollandus rendering the accompt,
p. 180: and John de Arnundeville assistant m him.
The King takes the balance of the revenue aster
certain paymeuts to other persons. This is amply
sufficient to prove that the roll belongs to some
one year during the period when the revenues of
the see were rendered by Escollaudus to the King.
But more than this is proved: for Escollandus, it
will be observed, makes three distinct returns :—
fixst, of the nova firma Episcopatus: second, of the
vetus firma Episcopatus preteriti anni z—and lastly,
of the remanens firma Episcopatus de tempore
