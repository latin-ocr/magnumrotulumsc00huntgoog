PREFACE.

find either in his Life or in his Diaries any especial
notice of this individua} roll, yet that he was a dili-
gent student among the records of the Exchequer
is manifest from those his writings, as well aa by the
numerous extracts made from Excheqner reem-ds,
which are now, in his own hand, among the manu-
scripts in the Harleian Collection at the British
Museum. Early in life he couceived the noble de-
sig-n of a critical history of the English nat-ion ; and
for this purpose he spent years among the records at
the Tower and in the Exchequer, deeming, as he
himself says, the results of his researches as being
⁴‘ the most ravishing and satisfying part of human
knowledge.”

The authority of D'Ewes was deservedly high.
The error of the original date was at once perceived:
and his own date was at once accepted by the anti-
quaries of the tirne. Dodworth, in 1643, places
what is written above in the front of his collectivus
out of this roll: and the new date received the sanc-
tion of sir william Dugdale, whu in his History of
the Bai-onage of England, printed in 1675, frequently
cites this roll as the roll of the Fisth uf Stephen.

It does however admit of complete demonstrativi]
that the date is erroneous. Sir simonds D’Ewes
has not made it a mere dictum that the roll belongs
to the year to which he has assigned it, but has
referred to particular portions of the record as con-
taining the grounds of his opinion. It is to he
regretted that his references are not more precise;
for a reference to a roll, or even to a membrane,
must still leave the reader in some doubt respecting
the particulas passage to which his attention should
be directed. The probability is, as is ohserved hy
Madox, that he had iu view a few passages in which
there is mention made of inore than one year: of
