In some of the rolls, the edges are in part worn away,
or the wtiting is become illegible. When Dudsworth
perused the roll, and made his excerpts from it, a few
passages were legible to him which are not legible
now: yet it has evidently been presented with the
care which so anfient and venerable a document de-
serves, and means have lately been taken forits still
better conservation.

But while the loss of the lower membrane of the
fourth roll is now the only loss which is apparent,
there is too much reason to think that several small
rolls, which originally made up the Great Roll, have
not descended to our times. Of some of the coun-
ties there are no returns at all; and of others only
slight notices, and by no means those ample returns
which we find made from other counties. The
counties which are thus omitted, or only imperfectly
uoticed, are these: Somerset, Worcester, Heresord,
Salop, Chester, Lancaster, Westmorland, Cumbet-
land, and the Bishoprick of Durham. In the rolls
of later date the returns from these counties corres-
pond with those from the rest of the kingdom : and
though, with respect to some of these enunties, a
plausible conjecture might be proposed to account
for the absence of theru, no plausible reason can be
assigned for the absence of others3 so that we are
driven to the conclusion that this Great Roll has at
some period been deprived of a few of the rotulets
of which it once consisted.

This mutilation must be referred to a remote
period. In the time of Madox it consisted uf the
same number of rolls as at preseut; and it may he
inferred from the extracts made from it by the
Antiquaries of the seventeenth century, that in their
time the roll consisted of no more than it does at
present.
