PREFACE.

Englanth which became at length, nsit still continue&
a fies of the Crown : the honour of Pontefract. The
original grnntee was an Ilhert de Laci, whose great
possessions are described in Domesday Book. From
him descended other Laeis, who held this fee till the
reign of Richard L, when Robert the last of them
deceased without issue. On his death the fee de-
scended to Albreda de Lizours, of whom there exists
a Fine of the fifth year of King Richard showing her
in possession, and to whom she disposed of it. The
question is how Albreda stood related to the Laci
lost seised; and Dugdak, together with the whole
body of later genealogists, have followed the Historia
Laceiorum, an historical fragment written not ear-
lier than the time of King Henry VL, printed in
the Monasticon from a Chartulary. The writer of
this little piene of history declares Alhreda to have
been half-sister ex parte materna to the last of the
Lacis. But as this would show a rule of descent of
which it is presul-ned no similar instance can be pro-
duced from those times, and might if admitted lead
to general conclusions that were erroneous in respect
to the inheritauce of seudal tenures under the early
monarchy‚ it is of importance to observe that in this
roll there is an entryin the accompts sor Nottingham-
shire aud Derbyshire that Rohert de Lizours paid
El. 6⁸. sd. that he might mke to wife the sister ο(
Ilhert de Laci, a second of that name; and there
can scarcely be a doubt that Albreda was the issue
of that marriage, was cousin and heir, not half-sister
and heir, of the last of the Lacis, and therefore a
par-taket of the blood of the Ilbert de Laci who was
the original grantee from the Conqueror.

It is proper to add that when the Commission on
the Public Records did me the honour to call in my
assistance in the performance os the important labours
